## Git vs. GitHub

_**Git**_ is a local version control system used for creating and saving own
programs. This means that you can check your *history* to control and organize
the files. Git is very useful when you have lots of projects and sub-topics to
work with.  
_**Github**_ is very similar to git where the commands are the same and you code.
However, there are many more benefits in using github. The main benefit is that
github is cloud-based, meaning you can share your program with other programmers
so people can *collaborate* on a project together. It is also a place where you
save your projects for yourself or for the public to see.

 _Example of the benefit of github:_ Something bad happened to your computer
 and and you lost all your information. Fortunately, you pushed your information
 to github where the information is saved in the cloud. With this benefit, you
 can easily get the project you worked so hard on back.

>Note: Git does not need github, but github needs git to function.

2. Enter your personal informations   
3. Finish the steps and verify your account 

After you finished creating a github account, you need to set up your ide. This 
is the place where you type your code and create projects.   
Since setting up the ide includes a lot of steps, here's a
